NAME
    chrootize - place command's binary and libraries in a chroot jail

SYNOPSIS
    chrootize [command] 

DESCRIPTION
    chrootize is a simple script that uses the current directory as a chroot
    jail. chrootize will recursively ensure that all libraries required by the
    command are imported into the chroot jail. 

SEE ALSO
    chroot(1), otool(1)

BUGS
    chrootize is not smart enough to copy over other non-library dependencies
    that the command might have, eg. Python site packages
